Description: Methods and tools for Singular Spectrum Analysis including decomposition,
             forecasting and gap-filling for univariate and multivariate time series.
             General description of the methods with many examples can be found in the book
             Golyandina (2018, <doi:10.1007/978-3-662-57380-8>).
